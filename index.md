# Bio
I'm Chris. IT enthusiast, novice homelabber; passionate about learning and passing on whatever I can
I've been working in or around the IT industry for a couple of years, but have been on a tech journey (whether I knew it or not) for decades.
I have always been big on technology in its various forms: computers, gaming, audio, video; and more recently homelabbing, networking, cybersecurity, and live streaming.

## It's not much, but it's a start
This is my first foray into the world of websites, so bear with me. This page is very much under construction and probably will be for the forseable future.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

The final element.
