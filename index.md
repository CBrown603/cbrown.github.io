# Bio
I'm Chris. IT enthusiast, novice homelabber; passionate about learning and passing on whatever I can.
I've been working in or around the IT industry for a couple of years, but I have been on a tech journey (whether I knew it or not) for most of my life.
I have always been big on technology in its various forms: computers, gaming, audio, video; and more recently homelabbing, networking, cybersecurity, and live streaming.

## It's not much, but it's a start
This is my first foray into the world of websites, so bear with me. This page is very much under construction and probably will be for the for3seable future.

### More to come, if all goes well
As time goes on, I'll be adding projects, writeups, and maybe tutorials or blogs. For right now, just getting this thing off the ground is the plan.

Thanks for stopping by!
